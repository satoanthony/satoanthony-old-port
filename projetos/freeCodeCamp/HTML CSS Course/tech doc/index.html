        <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for OS X, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve still regularly updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.</p>

        <p>The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in late 2018.</p>
          
        <p>Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised the game for its gameplay and faithfulness to the Counter-Strike series, though it was criticized for some early features and the differences between the console and PC versions. Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month and remains one of the most played games on Valve's Steam platform. In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from cosmetic items.</p>
          
        <p>The game has an active esports scene, continuing the history of international competitive play from previous games in the series. Teams compete in professional leagues and tournaments, with the game often cited as being among the best in esports.</p>

        <p>Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to repeatedly complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or capturing hostages. At the end of each short round, players are rewarded based on individual and team performance with in-game currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds generally rewards more money than losing does, and completing map-based objectives, including killing enemies, gives additional cash bonuses.</p>
        <p>Played competitively in teams of 5. In a defense x offense style gameplay, where one team (Counter-Terrorists) have to protect a pre determined location from the other team (Terrorists) from reaching and planting an explosive (C4), at which point the Terrorists have to defend the site for a period of time until the explosion occurs. </p>

        <p>Global Offensive has one of the most popular esport scenes in the world. The Global Offensive professional scene consists of leagues and tournaments hosted by third-party organizations, and Valve-sponsored tournaments known as Major Championships. Majors are considered the most prestigious tournaments in Counter-Strike circuit and have among the largest prize pools; originally announced at US$250,000, the prize pools for Majors have risen to US$1,000,000 since MLG Columbus 2016. Astralis is the most successful Global Offensive team of all time, with the core members of that team winning four Majors together.</p>
        <p>In 2014, the "first large match fixing scandal" in the Global Offensive community took place, where team iBuyPower purposefully lost a match against NetCodeGuides.com. The seven professional players that were involved in the scandal were permanently banned from all Majors by Valve, although some other organizers eventually allowed the players to compete at their tournaments.</p>

        <p>In 2020, the Counter-Strike coaching bug scandal erupted, where team coaches used variants of a bug to see parts of the map they normally would not have access to and gather information about the enemy team. As of May 5, 2022, the Esports Integrity Commission announced that almost 100 coaches would be sanctioned as they neared the completion of the final investigation.</p>

        <p>Esports organizations Cloud9 and Dignitas, among others, announced plans in February 2020 to launch Flashpoint, a franchise-based league for Counter-Strike, countering concerns over the state of the current promotion/relegation leagues. The league was to be owned by the teams rather than a single organization, similar to the Overwatch League.</p>

        <p>The controls are what give the player ability to do actions. They range from being able to fire a weapon to being able to talk on a microphone. The obvious differences between Counter-Strike controls and Counter-Strike: Source controls are small. In Counter-Strike: Source, they removed the ability to have an alternate key for controls. However, they have created separate controls for some of them.

          In Counter-Strike, the player can use fast weapon switching and the developer console by default. However, in Counter-Strike: Source, the player can enable or disable fast weapon switching and the developer console as they wish.</p>
        <p>To enable/disable fast weapon switching or the developer console:

          Go to the Main Menu.
          Go to Options.
          Go to the Keyboard tab.
          On the bottom of the Options window, click "Advanced...".
          Check/uncheck the boxes you want enabled/disabled.
          You can change any of the normal controls by doing the following:
          
          Go to the Main Menu.
          Go to Options.
          Go to the Keyboard tab.
          Click on the control you wish to change.
          Click "Edit Key" on the bottom of the Options window.
          Press the key you wish to change it to.
          Apply the changes.</p>
